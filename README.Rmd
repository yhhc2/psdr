## Overview

Author: Yong-Han Hank Cheng

This package allows you to generate and compare power spectral density (PSD)
plots given time series data. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to take a time 
series data, analyze the oscillations, and then output the frequencies of these 
oscillations in the time series in the form of a PSD plot.

Thus given a time series, the dominant frequencies in the time series can be 
identified. Additional functions in this package allow the dominant frequencies 
of multiple groups of time series to be compared with each other. 

To see example usage with the main functions of this package, please visit
